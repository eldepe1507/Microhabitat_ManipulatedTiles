# an error was due to not logging Area before - since it is a numerical variable and a poisson model I need to log it
# there are still converging warnings - maybe scaling Area will help

# Let's check overdispersion

ddf <- nrow(LOBrecruit.glmer1@frame) - length(fixef(LOBrecruit.glmer1))- length(VarCorr(LOBrecruit.glmer1)) # if it's a poisson, you don't need to substract an additional -1 at the end!!
adf <- df.residual(LOBrecruit.glmer1) # it can now calculate the degrees of freedom like that

# Residual plot:
plot(LOBrecruit.glmer1) # hmm, at least one point far off

# R squared
r.squaredGLMM(LOBrecruit.glmer1) # 10.1 % explained by fixed factors


# All looks alright, but just to check model fit, I will also run a negative binomial model

summary(LOBrecruit.mod.nb)
# Results are looking very similar to poisson model

# Let's check AIC:
AICc(LOBrecruit.glmer1, LOBrecruit.mod.nb) # poisson is better AND simpler!

# The Poisson model is the best one if it converges!
# I will go with the glmmTMB because it always converges!

#----------------------------------------

# Interpretation Model output:
# - More variance between location code than between tiles - good
# Significant interaction for three terms: TreatmentOpen:crevicekindmedium, TreatmentOpen:crevicekindsmall and TreatmentPartial:crevice.kindsmall
# Significant interaction for TreatmentOpen:Crevicemedium means:
# the number of Lobophora recruits in the medium crevice of the open treatment
# is log(1.4) higher than would be expected if I summed the effect of Open treatments if it was averaged over all crevices
# and for medium crevices if it was averaged over all treatments
# Significant interaction of TreatmentOpen:crevicesmall and TreatmentPartial:crevice small are similarly interpreted


# I will have to back transform my Estimates to get actual useful numbers
# My reference is large crevice and caged treatment

# Difference with Open treatment and medium crevice:
exp(1.4) # = 4.0552
# --> There are 4.1 times more recruits in the medium crevice of the open treatment than you would expect
# if you summed the baseline effect of Open Treatment vs Caged treatment (for reference crevice: large) 
# and medium crevice against large crevice (for reference treatment: caged)


# Difference with Open treatment and small crevices:
exp(2.06852) # 7.9131
# --> There are 7.9 times more recruits in the small crevice of the open treatment than you would expect 
# if you summed the baseline effect of Open Treatment vs Caged treatment (for reference crevice: large) 
# and small crevice against large crevice (for reference treatment: caged)

# Difference with Partial Treatment and small crevice:
exp(1.19743) # 3.3115
# --> There are 3.3 times more recruits in the small crevice of the partial treatment than you would expect 
# if you summed the baseline effect of Partial Treatment vs Caged treatment (for reference crevice large)
# and small crevice against large crevice (for reference treatment caged)


# Difference with Partial treatment and medium crevices (insignificant):
exp(-0.099) # 0.9057 
# --> there would be 0.91 times more recruits (so actually less) in the medium crevice of the partial treatment than you would expect
# if you summed the baseline effect of Partial Treatment  vs Caged treatment (for reference crevice: large)
# and medium crevice vs large crevice (for reference treatment: caged)

# Both small and medium crevices have more recruits than large crevices if they are caged or partially caged. 
# These are significant except for the medium crevice in a partial treatment
# Within the open treatment the effect is stronger in the small crevice than the medium crevice
# Within the partial treatment the effect is stronger for the smaller crevice than the medium crevice
# BUT small crevice in partial treatment is less strong than medium crevice in open treatment
# Partial treatment is somewhere between caged and open


## For my question, nesting my fixed factors may actually get me closer to what I want to know:
